            <p>It’s May 6th, 2012. Chris Cruz is facing a 0-0 count against Dartmouth in the bottom of the 11th inning.
                There’s one out, and his teammate, Brian Billigen, is on first base. Cornell is down one run.

        <div class="contentN">
            <p>Let’s talk about what’s at stake here. This is the third and final game of the Ivy League championship:
                the winner of this three game series will advance to the NCAA championship, where they’ll have a chance
                to compete among the nation’s best teams, while the loser will get sent home with nothing.</p>

            <p>He’s in front of 422 fans, the most that have ever been seated at Hoy Field since 2012, breaking the record 
                set the previous day, where 312 people filled the stands.</p>

            <p>The first pitch is a ball. 1-0.</p>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentN">
            <p>There’s an unbelievable amount of pressure on him right now. More eyes are watching than ever before. 
                He’s down a run in extras, meaning that if the team fails to score a run in this inning, they lose 
                the game. The one out may seem like a saving grace, but the runner on first means that a double play 
                could end the game, rather, the season, right there.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentW">
            <p>The team composition makes this situation all the more interesting. Cruz is going up against Dartmouth,
                 who’ve been in the last four Ivy League Championship Series, winning two of them. And while he doesn’t 
                 know it, they would appear in the three as well.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE">
            <p>Cruz also doesn’t know that Cornell baseball would 
                 peak right here, not appearing in another Championship Series and having a continually worse record 
                 year after year. Not capitalizing on this moment would be gut-wrenching.</p>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentN">
            <p>This is the embodiment of do-or-die, the last chance for him to win a title and cement his name in 
                baseball history. </p>

            <p>Here comes the second pitch, which Cruz fouls off. 1-1.</p>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE2">
            <p>Statistically, it is unlikely for Cornell to win this game. 
                There have been 53 total MLB games that at one point featured this exact 
                situation (11th inning, one out, runner on first, visitor up by one, 1-1 count).</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE2">
            <p>43 of them were won by the visitor (Dartmouth, in this case). 
                That’s a 19% win percentage for Cornell. </p>

    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentN">
            <p>But unlikeliness is what defines Chris Cruz.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE">
            <p>In his three seasons recorded in baseballR, he was a continually sub-par hitter.
                 His batting average in 2012 was 0.258, a touch below the average for all hitters
                  with more than 70 at-bats in a season (0.262). But what Cruz lacked in batting 
                  average, he made up for in Slugging Percentage, which weighs extra-base hits more 
                  heavily. </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentW2">
            <p>Here, in the quadrant defined by low batting averages and high slugging percentages, 
                Cruz stands alone. Though below average at batting, when Cruz does indeed hit the ball, 
                he hits it extremely well.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE">
            <p>In fact, his extra-base hitting is so good that it is second in Cornell history since 2012, 
                bested only by his teammate on first, Brian Billigen.

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE">
            <p>Of course, the best hit you can get off a ball is a home run, which Cruz did better 
                than anybody else. Once again, his batting average was below the norm, but the power 
                he possessed with his bat separated him from the rest of the competition.

    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentW2">
            <p>Here’s another look at his hitting, this time comparing slugging and home runs hit in a single season. 
                Cruz, in 2012, is miles ahead of the rest.
            </p>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE">
            <p>Perhaps the most damning charts are these, which measures how often a player hits 
                a homerun, given by the percent of hits that are home runs.
            </p>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE">
            <p>Cruz not only holds the top spot, but also the second. 
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentE">
            <p>Finally, in any given plate appearance, Cruz leads all players since 2012 for the 
                highest likelihood to hit a homerun, plus, leading up to this moment, Cruz was 
                one-shy of the Cornell single-seasons home run record - his success was historic.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div class="contentN">
            <p>	As a reflection of the numbers on Cruz’s batting average, he was 0 for 4 leading up to 
                this moment in the 11th. But getting consistent hits was never his specialty. Cruz was 
                swinging for the fences every single time, he lived and died by big swings. So, down one, 
                in the most do or die situation imaginable, needing a homerun, Cruz is the best person in 
                recent Cornell baseball history to send up to bat.
