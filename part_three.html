            <p>Of course, the best hit you can get off a ball is a home run, which Cruz did better 
                than anybody else. Once again, his batting average was below the norm, but the power 
                he possessed with his bat separated him from the rest of the competition.

            <p>Hereâ€™s another look at his hitting, this time comparing slugging and home runs hit in a single season. 
                Cruz, in 2012, is miles ahead of the rest.

            <p>Perhaps the most damning charts are these, which measures how often a player hits 
                a homerun, given by the percent of hits that are home runs.

            <p>Finally, in any given plate appearance, Cruz leads all players since 2012 for the 
                highest likelihood to hit a homerun, plus, leading up to this moment, Cruz was 
                one-shy of the Cornell single-seasons home run record - his success was historic.
